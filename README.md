# Make our algorithm live using REST API
## Business Logic
- We have a function that can take two arguments called start and end. Both arguments will be a valid integer number. The function will return a random value in the given range.
- We have a function that can generate a fake person profile including first name, last name, email, avatar, age and address. User can pass an array of selected properties and it will return a person object containing only given properties. Ex: generatePerson([’firstName’, ‘lastName’, ‘email’])
- We have a function that can accept a string as an argument and return an object containing the number of letters, number of symbols and number of numeric characters.
